# webforJ Explorer

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a **Tree Component** as a versatile UI component. While this example focuses on navigating and interacting with file systems, the tree component is not limited to files and directories. It can be adapted for various use cases, such as:

- Representing hierarchical data structures.
- Displaying nested categories or menus.
- Any scenario requiring a tree-like visualization.

This project serves as a showcase for building interactive and dynamic UI components using the webforJ framework.
